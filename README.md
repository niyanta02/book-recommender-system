# book-recommender-system

The Book Recommender System is a project that utilizes two different filtering techniques, namely Popular Filtering and Collaborative Filtering, to provide 
personalized book recommendations to users. The system is designed to cater to the needs of avid readers who are looking for new books to read and want to explore 
different genres and authors.

The Popular Filtering technique is used to recommend books that are popular among the user community as a whole. This is achieved by analyzing the reading history 
of a large number of users and identifying the books that are most frequently read and rated highly. The system then recommends these books to users who have similar 
reading habits.

Collaborative Filtering, on the other hand, is used to recommend books based on the reading habits of similar users. The system analyzes the reading history of a 
user and identifies other users who have similar reading patterns. It then recommends books that these similar users have enjoyed in the past.
